## Project Vision

In the competitive world of FIRST Robotics Competition, success is born from a blend of robust engineering and brilliant strategy. While most teams excel at the former, strategic decision-making often relies on intuition, incomplete data, and biased observations.

The **Blue Banner Engine (BBE)** aims to revolutionize FRC scouting by replacing guesswork with data science. Our mission is to build an open-source suite of intelligent tools that provide clear, actionable, and predictive insights. We empower teams to understand not just *what* happened, but *why* it happened and *what* is most likely to happen next, ultimately leading to more wins and more Blue Banners.

---

## Core Features & Modules

BBE is built on five interconnected pillars, each designed to solve a specific strategic challenge.

### 1. `Matchpoint` (MP) - The Oracle
- **What:** A machine learning model that predicts match outcomes, including the winning alliance and the final scores.
- **Why:** To provide an objective, data-driven forecast for upcoming matches, allowing teams to prioritize strategy and make informed decisions on offensive vs. defensive playstyles.
- **How:** By training a Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost) on thousands of historical match data points from The Blue Alliance and Statbotics.

### 2. `OPL` (Optimal Pick-Lister) - The Architect
- **What:** A simulation-based system that generates an **Optimal Pick List (OPL)** for alliance selection.
- **Why:** Alliance selection is the single most impactful moment of a competition. AOS moves beyond simple rankings to identify which available teams offer the greatest *synergistic advantage*, maximizing the probability of winning the elimination tournament.
- **How:** It uses a Monte Carlo simulation to run thousands of hypothetical tournament brackets, leveraging `Matchpoint` to predict performance and rank picks based on their marginal contribution to winning.

### 3. `The Playbook` (PBK) - The Coach
- **What:** An AI-powered engine that translates complex data into simple, actionable pre-match strategic advice.
- **Why:** A prediction is useless without a plan. `The Playbook` bridges the gap between data and on-field execution, giving the drive team clear, concise priorities.
- **How:** It uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand *why* `Matchpoint` made its prediction and generates a strategic brief with sections like "Our Key to Winning" and "Primary Threat."

### 4. `Heat Seeker` (HS) - The Cartographer
- **What:** A Computer Vision module that analyzes match videos to generate heatmaps and trajectory plots of robot movement.
- **Why:** API data doesn't capture spatial strategy. `Heat Seeker` reveals a team's field control, typical scoring paths, and defensive positioning.
- **How:** It uses a YOLOv8 object detection model to identify and track robots in match footage, aggregating positional data to visualize team behavior and patterns.

### 5. `Woodie` - The Omniscient
- **What:** A friendly conversational chatbot providing instant access to all FRC data and BBE insights.
- **Why:** To democratize data access for the entire team. Anyone can get immediate answers without needing complex dashboards, making data useful at the moment it's needed most.
- **How:** It integrates with The Blue Alliance API for live data and our internal BBE gRPC services for predictions, using modern NLP (RAG) to answer natural language questions.

## System Architecture

BBE is designed with a modern, decoupled, multi-container architecture, enabling scalability and maintainability. Communication between the Go API gateway and the Python ML service is handled efficiently via gRPC.

## Getting Started & Setup

Follow these instructions to set up and run the entire Blue Banner Engine stack locally.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following tools installed on your system:
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

### Configuration

#### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/armandomm09/bbe.git
cd bbe
```

#### 2. Obtain and Place the ML Models
The pre-trained machine learning models are required to run the prediction service. Due to their size, they are not stored in this Git repository.

*   **Action Required:** You must obtain the three model files (`classification.json`, `red_model.json`, `blue_model.json`) from the project maintainers.

*   **Placement:** Once you have the files, create a `models` directory in the root of the project and place them inside:
    ```
    bbe/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ classification.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ red_model.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blue_model.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ matchpoint/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (resto de los archivos)
    ```

#### 3. Create the Environment File
The Python service requires an API key for The Blue Alliance. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.

1.  Copy the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *(Note: If `.env.example` does not exist, create a new file named `.env`)*

2.  Edit the `.env` file and add your key:
    ```
    TBA_API_KEY="your_tba_api_key_here"
    ```

### Running the Application

With Docker, the entire application stack can be launched with a single command.

1.  **Build and Run the Containers:**
    From the root directory of the project, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    -   `--build`: This flag tells Docker Compose to rebuild the images if any changes have been made to the `Dockerfiles` or the source code.
    -   This command will start the Go API Gateway, the Python gRPC service, and the network connecting them.

2.  **Access the Services:**
    Once the containers are running, the application will be available at:
    -   **Frontend UI:** [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
    -   **API Documentation (Swagger):** [http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html)

3.  **Stopping the Application:**
    To stop all running containers, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `docker-compose` is running. To clean up completely, you can run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
